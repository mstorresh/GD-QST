# Quantum state tomography with Gradient-descent 


## Installation and use

Install the environment.yml or you can install the libraries by yourself, but be carefull with the version of QuTip, in our case we are using the qutip==5.0.0a2

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml

The notebooks in the `examples` folder are tutorials on how to do the quantum state tomography with the different methods of gradient-descent.
